

Numba, NumPy, and matplotlib libraries are required for the program to run.

matplotlib library was used in order to plot the paths generated by the drones, in addition to plotting some statistical information.

NumPy and Numba libraries were used to leverage the high computation performance of ufuncs (universal functions) and vectorized operations.
